# Pokémon Emerald


This is my personalized version of Pokémon Emerald built on top of pret/pokeemerald.
Changes include optimization, experimental mechanics, and cleaned symbols.
Maintained and modified by @nguyenharry1.


This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.

It builds the following ROM:

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
